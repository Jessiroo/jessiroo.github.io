          This was the first solo project I worked on. It was originally intended to be a small project to practice with, but it quickly grew as I kept coming up with new ideas to expand upon it with new features and functionalities. It has fetch and post requests, makes use of React Router, has a featured carousel, filtering, custom hooks, context, and more...

          This was one of the projects I worked on while doing Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's course: React - The Complete Guide. In order to maximize my learning from the course I would frequently pause the video and code ahead of the instructor. During large projects like this, I would look ahead to see what the desired end-product looked like and attempt to re-create it ahead of time. Once finished, I would start another project and code along with the instructor to get more practice and see how our solutions differed. This was my code-ahead version of this project.
