          This was the first solo project I worked on. It was originally intended to be a small project to practice with, but it quickly grew as I kept coming up with new ideas to expand upon it with new features and functionalities. It has fetch and post requests, makes use of React Router, has a featured carousel, filtering, custom hooks, context, and more...

          This is a tic tac toe game using features like context, custom hooks and reducers. In addition to checking for game win states, it randomizes starting player on subsequent games, keeps score, and can clear the board individually or clear all game data.

          This was one of the projects I worked on while doing Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's course: React - The Complete Guide. In order to maximize my learning from the course I would frequently pause the video and code ahead of the instructor. During large projects like this, I would look ahead to see what the desired end-product looked like and attempt to re-create it ahead of time. Once finished, I would start another project and code along with the instructor to get more practice and see how our solutions differed. This was my code-ahead version of this project.
