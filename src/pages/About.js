      <p>I started out my career as a nurse and quickly moved up to working in the Shock Trauma Intensive Care Unit at a major medical center. It was a demanding and rewarding profession which allowed me ample opportunity to engage in complex problem solving and critical thinking in a high-stakes environment. Following the conclusion of the pandemic however, I decided that nursing wasn’t something I wanted to spend the rest of my life doing. My dad always told me, “we spend so much of our lives working, it is important to do something we are passionate about.”</p>
      <p>My dad has always been a self-professed computer nerd, working as the director of IT in his own career, and he raised both his daughters to be the same. Some of my fondest early memories are of playing pc games with my dad, and shortly thereafter on my own computer, so it is fair to say I have been playing with computers since the time I could toddle. I am also passionate about learning, and love the thrill of finding solutions to complex problems.</p>
      <p>Cue my transition to web development and coding, where I have the opportunity to do both!</p>
      <p>When I am not coding, I enjoy playing a variety of video games, horseback riding, dirt-biking, skiing, writing, and learning random information about anything and everything.</p>
